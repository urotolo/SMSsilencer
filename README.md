# SMSsilencer
RSA encrypted SMS


So the main files are:
.java
.xml
gradle files
Manifest file


I unfortunately was not able to use version control to directly import my project from android studio.
Therefore I was forced to manually add most of them here. I could have uploaded all 100% of the files on google 
drive however as a programmer I felt github was a better source of storage overall.

Happy Hacking,
Best Regards
